Speculation on FFT data format:

datarow 0xf1: initial Fourier transform value pair (once)
datarow 0x82: rest of Fourier transform value pairs (255)

Value pairs are presumably cosine/sine pairs.

Timing suggests approximately one packet per second.  
Or perhaps one packet per 515/512 seconds?
